## Project Overview

This project is a **"Blog Platform"** developed using Angular integrated with Firebase services. The project demonstrates how to implement core web application features such as Firebase Authentication, Firestore for data storage, and Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality. It also focuses on deploying the app to Firebase Hosting with SEO optimization techniques. The goal is to learn how to combine Firebase services with Angular while following best practices for SEO and progressive web development.

### Learning Objectives:

1. **Firebase Authentication** - Implement email/password registration and login, with an option for Google sign-in.
2. **Firestore Database** - Design and implement CRUD operations for blog posts, with real-time updates for comments.
3. **SEO Optimization** - Set up server-side rendering (SSR) using Angular Universal and manage dynamic meta tags.
4. **Progressive Web App (PWA)** - Implement a service worker for offline access and cache previously viewed posts.
5. **Firebase Analytics** - Set up analytics tracking for page views and user interactions.
6. **Deployment** - Deploy the application to Firebase Hosting.
